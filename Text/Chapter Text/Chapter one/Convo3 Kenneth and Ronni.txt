#Ronni
Hey Kenny, how're you holding up?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
About as well as expected I guess.[A]
[MidRight]
#Ronni
I wouldn't worry if I were you,[NL]
these are just a few bandit[NL][A]
stragglers. They normally don't come[NL]
in such small numbers. Just make[NL][A]
sure not to go too far ahead and[NL]
you should be fine.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
Say Ronni, how long have you been[NL]
in the Duramontis army?[A]
[MidRight]
#Ronni
Oh, about three years give[NL]
or take a month. Why?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kennth
That long huh? I'm not sure I could[NL]
handle this for that long, and be[NL][A]
so laid back about it no less.[A]
[MidRight]
#Ronni
It gets easier to deal with[NL]
in time. Though I suppose[NL][A]
that doesn't apply to Devan.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenenth
You're on a first name[NL]
basis with Lord Devan?[NL][A]
[MidRight]
#Ronni
Woops. Didn't mean to let that slip.[NL]
Yeah, we knew each other since we[NL][A]
were kids. We met about a year[NL]
before Devan inherited the throne[NL][A]
and- Oh! There goes a bandit. Let's[NL]
talk about this later.[A]

...Did she just ride towards[NL]
the enemy ahead of me?[A]
