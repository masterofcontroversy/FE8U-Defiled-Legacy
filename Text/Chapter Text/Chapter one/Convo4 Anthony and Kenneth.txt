I was thinking about what you said[NL]
earlier. About mounted solders being[NL][A]
in the advance team.[A]

And?[A]

#Kenneth
Why are you here? You don't ride a[NL]
horse or seem to be a commander.[NL][A]
Wouldn't it make more sense for you[NL]
to guard the village with the[NL][A]
infantry?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Anthony
Maybe, but I have somethin' very[NL]
useful for huntin' down bandits.[A]
[MidRight]
#Kenneth
What?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Anthony
Experience workin' with em.[A]
[MidRight]
#Kenneth
You mean you used to be a raider?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Anthony
Yup. Just like the men you see here,[NL]
I got in a bad way and turned to[NL][A]
pillaging as a source of food.[A]
[MidRight]
#Kennth
So, how did you end up[NL]
working for Lord Devan?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Anthony
It's a long story, and we don't have[NL]
the time. Tell ya what? If you live[NL][A]
long enough, I might tell you.[A]
[MidRight]
#Kenneth
I'll try.[A]
