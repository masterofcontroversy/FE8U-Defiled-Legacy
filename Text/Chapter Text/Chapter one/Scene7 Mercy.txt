I don't have much time to waste,[NL]
so I'll be blunt. Where are the rest[NL][A]
of the bandits going?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Bandit
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[Right]
#Devan
Not saying anything huh? You don't[NL]
have any reason to not tell me. You[NL][A]
have the choice between a slow[NL]
agonizing death or a rare display[NL][A]
of mercy. Which one will it be?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Bandit
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove]All they told me was that we[NL]
were headed north.[A]
[Right]
#Devan
Thank you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove] Execute him,[NL]
and make it swift.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Bandit
Wait, what?[A]

No! NOOO![A]

Man, I hate it when you do that.[A]

#Kenneth
My gods... What did I just see?[A]
[FarRight]
#Anthony
About the norm I'd say. Oh,[NL]
that's right, you're new.[A]
[Right]
#Kenneth
Didn't Lord Devan say he[NL]
would show that bandit mercy?[A]
[FarRight]
#Anthony
Yeah, he did. Normally when he has[NL]
someone executed, the death is very[NL][A]
long and drown out. That sucker's going[NL]
to die a fast death.[A]
[Right]
#Kenneth
But we captured him! Shouldn't[NL]
we imprison him and make[NL][A]
him stand trial?[A]
[Left][LoadDevan][FarLeft][LoadRonni]
[Left]
#Devan
Trust me, it's never[NL]
worth the trouble.[A]
[Right]
#Kenneth
Lord Devan!![A]
[Left]
#Devan
If we have them stand trial they[NL]
will still die for their crimes.[NL][A]
The only difference is that their[NL]
families will get more involved than[NL][A]
usual. And no one Likes dealing[NL]
with that.[A]
[Right]
#Kenneth
Wait, you mean these bandits[NL]
have families? how many?[A]
[FarRight]
#Anthony
Just about all of 'em.[A]
[Right]
If these men have families to take[NL]
care of, why did they[NL][A]
become[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove] bandits[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[FarLeft]
#Ronni
Yeah, pretty sad huh? Our nation[NL]
is so poor that a lot of regular[NL][A]
people have to resort to banditry to[NL]
feed themselves and their families.[A]
[Left]
#Devan
It's been like this for generations,[NL]
and I don't see it getting better[NL][A]
anytime soon.[A]
[Right]
#Kenneth
That's terrible.[A]
[FarRight]
That's the state of our country.[NL]
Sorry kid, I don't like it any more[NL][A]
than you do, maybe even less, but[NL]
that's just how it is.[A]
[Left]
#Devan
Anthony, do you know of any[NL]
bandit hideouts north of here?[A]
[FarRight]
#Anthony
Yeah, there were a few old places.[NL]
Let me get a map.[A]
[FarRight][ClearFace]
[Left]
#Devan
Ronni, you coming?[A]
[FarLeft]
#Ronni
Nah. I think I'll talk to Kenny for a bit.[A]
[Left]
#Devan
Alright.[A]
[Left][ClearFace]
[Right]
#Kenneth
Forced to fight your own people on[NL]
a regular basis[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove] No wonder the[NL][A]
military is so somber. And Lord[NL]
Devan[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove] Hey Ronni, why does Lord[NL][A]
Devan let you speak so casually[NL]
to him?[A]
[FarLeft]
#Ronni
Hmm? I guess I droped the title a[NL]
bit too much eh? Well, It was about[NL][A]
six years ago when we met. Devan was[NL]
a year away from inheriting the[NL][A]
throne and-
[Right]
#Kenneth
Lord Devan asended to the[NL]
throne at age twelve?[A]
[FarLeft]
#Ronni
Yup. Anyway, my mom and I were poor,[NL]
so when my mom was offered a job at[NL][A]
the castle it was basically a[NL]
no-brainer. After we moved into the[NL][A]
servant's quarters I decided to do[NL]
some exploring.[A]
[Right]
#Kenneth
You mean snooping around in places[NL]
you weren't supposed to be?[A]
[FarLeft]
#Ronni
Yes. While I was "snooping", I found[NL]
Devan working on his lance arm. He[NL][A]
was so focused on the dummy he didn't[NL]
notice me come in. He was wearing[NL][A]
training armor so I thought he was a[NL]
recruit, so I decided to[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove]ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove]teach[NL][A]
him the importance of the element[NL]
of surprise.[A]
[Right]
#Kenneth
You snuck up on Lord Devan?[A]
[FarLeft]
#Ronni
You like asking questions with[NL]
obvious answers don't you?[A]
[Right]
#Kenneth
Oh, sorry.[A]
[FarLeft]
#Ronni
Moving on... I got a little closer[NL]
to Devan, stayed just out of spear [NL][A]
range and then said hi. Turns out I[NL]
underestimated His reach. He turned[NL][A]
around and swept his lance at my[NL]
feet knocking me down. Then he[NL][A]
pointed it at me demanding to know[NL]
who I was. While I laughed at him he[NL][A]
prodded his lance at my chest[NL]
accusing me of being a thief. It[NL][A]
then dawned on me that I was talking[NL]
to the young prince of the castle. I[NL][A]
asked who he was, he answered, then[NL]
I explained myself. After getting a[NL][A]
very long lecture from my mom for[NL]
almost making her lose her new job,[NL][A]
Devan and I started the slow[NL]
process of becoming freinds.[A]

#NOTE: And the award for biggest wall of text goes to Ronni!

[FarFarLeft]
#Devan
Ronni! Kenneth! We're leaving![A]
[FarLeft]
#Ronni
Welp, there's the call of duty.[NL]
Better get going.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace]
[Right]
#Kenneth
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove]So Lord Devan was tough[NL]
even at a young age.[A]
