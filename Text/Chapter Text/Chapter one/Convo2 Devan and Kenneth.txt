Whew.[A]
[MidRight][LoadDevan]
#Devan
Getting tired already?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
Oh, ah. No sir.[NL]
I'm good to go for hours.[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
I was talking more about[NL]
your mental state. This[NL][A]
is your first battle after all.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove]in that case, I'm doing[NL]
pretty bad I guess.[NL][A]
I'm amazed I haven't thrown up.[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
For someone so uncomfortable with[NL]
fighting, you're awfully skilled[NL][A]
with weaponry.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
That's thanks to my sister. She's a[NL]
knight in the holy kingdom, she[NL][A]
tought me how to use a sword and[NL]
lance mostly for self defense.[NL][A]
The time I spent training with[NL]
the other recruits helped me[NL][A]
polish those skills.[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
I see... Then in that case maybe[NL]
I can rely on you to keep up with[NL][A]
me. Let's go.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
Yes sir![A]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
#Devan
Oh, and Kenneth![A]
[MidLeft][LoadKenneth]
#Kenneth
Yes?[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
You probably should use your sword[NL]
against the brigands instead of[NL][A]
that lance.[A]

#Kenneth
Oh. Oops. Hehe[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove][A]
