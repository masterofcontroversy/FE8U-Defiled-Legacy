Ronni![A]
[MidLeft][LoadRonni]
Yeah?[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
How are the preperations[NL]
to leave going?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Ronni
Great...[....] 'cept for Kenny.[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
Let me guess: He's getting the shakes.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Ronni
Yup.[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
*sigh*... I'll handle it.[A]

#Kenneth
Ah...[.....] Duke Devan![A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
How many times do I have to tell[NL]
you to stop calling me that? It[NL][A]
Sounds like the title of some[NL]
children's song.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
Oh. I'm sorry Lord Devan.[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
Nevermind that. I heard[NL]
you're getting cold feet?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
Well...[.....]yes since this[NL]
is my first sortie...[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
What's the problem? The idea of[NL]
killing on the battle field? The[NL][A]
possibility of being killed? An[NL]
injury so bad that it would be[NL][A]
better to die?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
That's about the gist of it, yes.[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
If that's all your worried about[NL]
then you should be fine.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
Wait, there's more to be worried[NL]
about?[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
Kenneth, why did you join my company?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
To prove to my sister that[NL]
I can take care of myself.[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
If that's the case you made a poor[NL]
decision. Don't worry, The only[NL][A]
people that died under my command[NL]
were either too brave or too stupid[NL][A]
to follow orders. You're neither, so[NL]
you should be fine.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove]thanks?[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
Now finish getting ready,[NL]
we're about to leave.[A]
