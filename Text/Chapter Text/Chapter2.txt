#Kenneth
Lord Devan[A]
[FarRight]
#Anthony
What're the new orders[A]
[FarLeft]
#Devan
Well, as you know, searching around[NL]
the old bandit hideouts lead us[A][NL]
nowhere, so now we're going to be[NL]
checking the villages starting with[A][NL]
Evans.[A]
[FarRight]
#Anthony
Evans? what bandit in their[NL]
right mind would hide there?[A]
[FarLeft]
#Devan
None, which is precisely why I[NL]
want to do a sweep of the area.[A][NL]
Maybe Abigail will be willing to[NL]
give us a bird's eye view.[A]
[MidRight]
#Kenneth
Hold on, why would the bandits not[NL]
want to go to Evans? And[A][NL]
who's Abigail?[A]
[FarRight]
#Anthony
I can answer both questions at once.[NL]
Abigail's an old general from[A][NL]
Cassis. She retired early to take[NL]
care of her granddaughter. Everyone[A][NL]
in Duramontis knows not to mess with[NL]
her.[A]
[FarLeft]
#Devan
Thanks to her, Evans has the lowest [NL]
crime rate in the country. Aside[A][NL]
from the capitol of course.[A]
[MidRight]
#Kenneth
She sounds tough. But why live in[NL]
Duramontis instead of Cassis or[A][NL]
Tolva? Wouldn't they be safer locations?[A]
[FarRight]
#Anthony
No idea, but I reckon she's safe[NL]
just about anywhere she goes.[A]
[FarLeft]
#Devan
Well, regardless of where she lives[NL]
we're still checking Evans.[A][NL]
While we're at it we-

[MoveMidLeft]
[FarLeft]
#Devan
Hello Ronni, how was your hunting[NL]
trip? Get any venison perchance?[A]
[FarRight]
#Anthony
My money's on pork.[A]
[MidRight]
#Kenneth
Please let it be turky.
[MidLeft]
#Ronni
Er...no, I didn't catch any meat.[NL]
I did see a few bandits though.[A][NL]
They said that they were going to rob[NL]
a caravan not far from here.[A]
[FarLeft]
#Devan
A caravan huh? Kenneth, Tell the[NL]
solders that they are to go in[A][NL]
pairs to the nearby villages and[NL]
ask about any caravans or potential[A][NL]
bandit hideouts.[A]
[FarRight]
#Anthony
And some food.[A]
[FarLeft]
#Devan
...And tell them to[NL]
get some provisions.[A]
[MidRight]
#Kenneth
Yes sir.[A]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[FarLeft]
#Anthony
What do we do now?[A]
At the moment, wait. The best thing[NL]
to do is be ready to pursue the[A][NL]
bandits as soon we know where they[NL]
are. I just hope that will be soon...[A]
