Stay here you three.[NL]
I'll be right back.[A]

[Left]
#Kenneth
[...]He's going to the bar. What[NL]
business does he need to handle there?[A]
[FarLeft]
#Ronni
Probably getting smashed. Devan's[NL]
a heavy drinker don't ya know?[A]
[Left]
#Kenneth
What?![A]
[FarLeft]
#Ronni
Just kidding. There's someone Devan's[NL]
looking for, and he's probably in[A][NL]
the bar.[A]
[MidRight]
#Brent
Who would that be?[A]
[FarLeft]
#Ronni
Well[...]

## Ch3_Colton
[MidLeft][LoadColton]
#Colton
Ahh[...]that's the stuff[...][NL]
I needed a break.[A]
[MidRight][LoadDevan]
#Devan
Ah Colton, I thought[NL]
I'd find you here.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Colton
Congratulations, you found me.[NL]
I suppose you're here to discuss[A][NL]
the recent...events going in the[NL]
country?[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
That's correct. I need you to tell[NL]
me where these bandits are hiding.[A][NL]
And if you don't know, tell me where[NL]
I can find someone who does.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Colton
One problem: The guy you want to mess[NL]
with is tough stuff. He killed Abigail[A][NL]
single handedly! How do you intend to[NL]
kill him?[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
I've had some new additions to my[NL]
group that should even the odds. Even[NL][A]
if I didn't have their help, I can't[NL]
just do nothing.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Colton
...Okay then, why?[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
Why what?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Colton
Why do you even bother fighting for[NL]
this gods forsaken hellhole? The very[A][NL]
people you save, if you even manage to[NL]
save anyone, sooner or later will[A][NL]
become the very thing you saved them[NL]
from. It's an endless cycle that's not[A][NL]
worth fighting for. So why fight for it?[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
[...]Speaking honesty[...] It's all I[NL]
know. As I grew up, my uncle taught me[A][NL]
how to fight for Duramontis,[NL]
how to[...]help the country die[A][NL]
peacfully, and how not to quit. The[NL]
last one especially. I can't quit. If[A][NL]
I do, I wouldn't be any better than[]...][A]
[MidLeft]
#Colton
[...]Her?[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
Yes[...]her. That's why I'm still doing[NL]
this. [...]Though, the real test is if[A][NL]
I'll be able to say that years from[NL]
now.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Devan
So, presently speaking, there's[NL]
no talking you out of this?[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
No.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Colton
You never fail to impress me with[NL]
that ridiculous determination of[A][NL]
yours. You might just live through[NL]
fighting Gregory.[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
So that's his name... I take[NL]
it this means you'll help?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Colton
I guess[...] But if you die, I'm out.[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
Noted.[A]

There they are.[A]

[Right]
#Ronni
Hey, Colton. Been a while, hasn't it?[A]
[FarLeft]
#Colton
Right. I remember you[...][NL]
You're the golpher right?[A]
[Right]
#Ronni
Eh. Better than being a rat.[A]
[Left]
#Devan
Enough you two. Colton,[NL]
where is Gregory hiding?[A]
[FarLeft]
#Colton
All in good time. I need to handle[NL]
some unfinished business, and you[A][NL]
probably need to rest, what with you[NL]
running back and forth through the[A][NL]
mountains and all.[A]
[Left]
#Devan
You know, if you tell us now,[NL]
we could just prepare and you[A][NL]
wouldn't even have to go with us.[A]
[FarLeft]
#Colton
No, no I'm going with you. Can you[NL]
imagine how much loot Gregory has?[A][NL]
Besides, there's no way to prepare[NL]
for where we're going.[A]
[Left]
#Devan
[...]Fine. We'll be staying at the[NL]
inn. Meet us there at dawn.[A]
[FarLeft]
#Colton
*sigh* Not even enough time to get[NL]
over my hangover[...]? Alright,[NL][A]
see you at dawn.[A]
[FarLeft] [ClearFace]
[FarRight]
#Brent
So, we're taking it easy tonight[A]
[Left]
#Devan
I guess so.[A]
