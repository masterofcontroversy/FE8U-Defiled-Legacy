[FarFarLeft][LoadRonni]
Hey Devan, there's a bandit attack[NL]
going on over in Tristan![A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
[Beat]mmm[Beat][OpenEyes]ugh[Beat][A]
[FarFarLeft]
#Ronni
You might want to get up sometime[NL]
today, those bandits probably won't[NL][A]
wait for you to finish your nap.[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove]Tell the troops we sortie[NL]
in fifteen minutes.[A]
[FarFarLeft]

## Ch1_Family
[MidLeft][LoadDevan][MidRight][LoadIsaac]
Ah Devan, you're awake.[NL]
I take it you heard about[NL][A]
the raid in Tristan?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Devan
Yes Uncle, I heard. I'm leaving in[NL]
about ten minutes. Of course the[NL][A]
raid had to happen while I was in[NL]
the middle of the best sleep I had[NL][A]
In weeks[A]
[MidRight]
#Isaac
Well, the raiders never seemed to be[NL]
concerned with stealing on when it's[NL][A]
convient. Before you leave, you[NL]
should get something to eat.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Devan
I'll be fine. I'll just eat some[NL]
jerky on the way or something. I'm[NL][A]
going to the barrocks to check on[NL]
the troops. While I'm gone hold down[NL][A]
the fort.[A]
[MidRight]
#Isaac
Alright. Safe travels.[A]
[X]

## Ch1_Bravery
[MidRight][LoadDevan]
Ronni![A]
[MidLeft][LoadRonni]
Yeah?[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
How are the preperations[NL]
to leave going?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Ronni
Great...[....] 'cept for Kenny.[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
Let me guess: He's getting the shakes.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Ronni
Yup.[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
*sigh*... I'll handle it.[A]
[MidRight][ClearFace][MidLeft][ClearFace]
[Right][LoadKenneth][MidRight][LoadDevan]
#Devan
Kenneth.[A]
[Right][MoveMidLeft]
[MidLeft][ClearFace][LoadKenneth]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
Ah...[.....] Duke Devan![A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
How many times do I have to tell[NL]
you to stop calling me that? It[NL][A]
Sounds like the title of some[NL]
children's song.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
Oh. I'm sorry Lord Devan.[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
Nevermind that. I heard[NL]
you're getting cold feet?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
Well...[.....]yes since this[NL]
is my first sortie...[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
What's the problem? The idea of[NL]
killing on the battle field? The[NL][A]
possibility of being killed? An[NL]
injury so bad that it would be[NL][A]
better to die?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
That's about the gist of it, yes.[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
If that's all your worried about[NL]
then you should be fine.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
Wait, there's more to be worried[NL]
about?[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
Kenneth, why did you join my company?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
To prove to my sister that[NL]
I can take care of myself.[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
If that's the case you made a poor[NL]
decision. Don't worry, The only[NL][A]
people that died under my command[NL]
were either too brave or too stupid[NL][A]
to follow orders. You're neither, so[NL]
you should be fine.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove]thanks?[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
Now finish getting ready,[NL]
we're about to leave.[A]

## Ch1_Sortie
[MidLeft][LoadDevan][MidRight][LoadRonni]
#Ronni
We're ready to go Devan.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Devan
Thank you. [A]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
#Devan
Alright! As you know Tristan is[NL]
currently being raided by bandits![NL][A]
By the time we get  there, the[NL]
bandits will already be gone, so[NL][A]
we will be cutting them off at[NL]
Edmund's pass! Understood?[A]
[FarFarRight]
#Solders
Yes sir![A]
[MidLeft]
#Devan
Alright. Foward![A]
[X]

## Ch1_Trail
[MidLeft][LoadRonni]
Lord Devan, I found some tracks![A]
[MidRight][LoadDevan]
They're fresh. We just missed them.[NL]
Tell the rear guard to protect the[NL][A]
village. We'll be able to chase the[NL]
raiders faster with fewer numbers.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Ronni
Aye aye.[A]
[MidLeft][ClearFace][MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadKenneth][ToggleMouthMove]
(Whew, no bandits. Maybe I can stay[NL]
with the rear guard.)[ToggleMouthMove][NL][A]
[MidRight][LoadAnthony]
Hey, new Blood.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
Huh?[A]
[MidRight]
#Anthony
Heh, you've got a relieved look on[NL]
your face. You really think you're[NL][A]
staying with the rear guard?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
Well, I mean, it would make sense[NL]
since this is my first time.[A]
[MidRight]
#Anthony
You got a horse kid?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove]yes.[A]
[MidRight]
#Anthony
You're going with the advance squad.[NL]
All mounted solders are a part of[NL][A]
the advance squad.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[MidRight]
#Anthony
Don't worry kid, I'm going too, so[NL]
maybe you won't get yourself killed.[NL][A]
Name's Anthony by the way.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove]Kenneth.[A]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove]
Well there goes that. Come on Kenny,[NL]
you can do this. Show Brittany that[NL][A]
you can handle yourself.[A]
[X]

## Ch1_Targets_Found
[MidRight][LoadDevan]
This is it. I can see some[NL]
stragglers. Kenneth, Ronni,[NL][A]
Anthony, you're with me. The rest[NL]
of you, handle the surrounding area.[A]
[X]

## Ch1_Mercy
#NOTE: Use Portrait 4D for the bandit
[Right][LoadDevan][FarRight][LoadRonni]
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x4D][0x1]
[Right]
#Devan
I don't have much time to waste,[NL]
so I'll be blunt. Where are the rest[NL][A]
of the bandits going?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Bandit
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[Right]
#Devan
Not saying anything huh? You don't[NL]
have any reason to not tell me. You[NL][A]
have the choice between a slow[NL]
agonizing death or a rare display[NL][A]
of mercy. Which one will it be?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Bandit
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove]All they told me was that we[NL]
were headed north.[A]
[Right]
#Devan
Thank you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove] Execute him,[NL]
and make it swift.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Bandit
Wait, what?[A]
[FarLeft][LoadFace][0x6A][0x1]
[MidLeft][ClearFace][FarLeft][ClearFace]
[FarFarLeft]
#Bandit
No! NOOO![A]
[FarRight]
#Ronni
Man, I hate it when you do that.[A]
[Right]
#Devan
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[Right][ClearFace][FarRight][ClearFace]

[Right][LoadKenneth]
[FarRight][LoadAnthony]
[Right]
#Kenneth
My gods... What did I just see?[A]
[FarRight]
#Anthony
About the norm I'd say. Oh,[NL]
that's right, you're new.[A]
[Right]
#Kenneth
Didn't Lord Devan say he[NL]
would show that bandit mercy?[A]
[FarRight]
#Anthony
Yeah, he did. Normally when he has[NL]
someone executed, the death is very[NL][A]
long and drown out. That sucker's going[NL]
to die a fast death.[A]
[Right]
#Kenneth
But we captured him! Shouldn't[NL]
we imprison him and make[NL][A]
him stand trial?[A]
[Left][LoadDevan][FarLeft][LoadRonni]
[Left]
#Devan
Trust me, it's never[NL]
worth the trouble.[A]
[Right]
#Kenneth
Lord Devan!![A]
[Left]
#Devan
If we have them stand trial they[NL]
will still die for their crimes.[NL][A]
The only difference is that their[NL]
families will get more involved than[NL][A]
usual. And no one Likes dealing[NL]
with that.[A]
[Right]
#Kenneth
Wait, you mean these bandits[NL]
have families? how many?[A]
[FarRight]
#Anthony
Just about all of 'em.[A]
[Right]
If these men have families to take[NL]
care of, why did they[NL][A]
become[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove] bandits[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[FarLeft]
#Ronni
Yeah, pretty sad huh? Our nation[NL]
is so poor that a lot of regular[NL][A]
people have to resort to banditry to[NL]
feed themselves and their families.[A]
[Left]
#Devan
It's been like this for generations,[NL]
and I don't see it getting better[NL][A]
anytime soon.[A]
[Right]
#Kenneth
That's terrible.[A]
[FarRight]
That's the state of our country.[NL]
Sorry kid, I don't like it any more[NL][A]
than you do, maybe even less, but[NL]
that's just how it is.[A]
[Left]
#Devan
Anthony, do you know of any[NL]
bandit hideouts north of here?[A]
[FarRight]
#Anthony
Yeah, there were a few old places.[NL]
Let me get a map.[A]
[FarRight][ClearFace]
[Left]
#Devan
Ronni, you coming?[A]
[FarLeft]
#Ronni
Nah. I think I'll talk to Kenny for a bit.[A]
[Left]
#Devan
Alright.[A]
[Left][ClearFace]
[Right]
#Kenneth
Forced to fight your own people on[NL]
a regular basis[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove] No wonder the[NL][A]
military is so somber. And Lord[NL]
Devan[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove] Hey Ronni, why does Lord[NL][A]
Devan let you speak so casually[NL]
to him?[A]
[FarLeft]
#Ronni
Hmm? I guess I droped the title a[NL]
bit too much eh? Well, It was about[NL][A]
six years ago when we met. Devan was[NL]
a year away from inheriting the[NL][A]
throne and-
[Right]
#Kenneth
Lord Devan asended to the[NL]
throne at age twelve?[A]
[FarLeft]
#Ronni
Yup. Anyway, my mom and I were poor,[NL]
so when my mom was offered a job at[NL][A]
the castle it was basically a[NL]
no-brainer. After we moved into the[NL][A]
servant's quarters I decided to do[NL]
some exploring.[A]
[Right]
#Kenneth
You mean snooping around in places[NL]
you weren't supposed to be?[A]
[FarLeft]
#Ronni
Yes. While I was "snooping", I found[NL]
Devan working on his lance arm. He[NL][A]
was so focused on the dummy he didn't[NL]
notice me come in. He was wearing[NL][A]
training armor so I thought he was a[NL]
recruit, so I decided to[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove]ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove]teach[NL][A]
him the importance of the element[NL]
of surprise.[A]
[Right]
#Kenneth
You snuck up on Lord Devan?[A]
[FarLeft]
#Ronni
You like asking questions with[NL]
obvious answers don't you?[A]
[Right]
#Kenneth
Oh, sorry.[A]
[FarLeft]
#Ronni
Moving on... I got a little closer[NL]
to Devan, stayed just out of spear [NL][A]
range and then said hi. Turns out I[NL]
underestimated His reach. He turned[NL][A]
around and swept his lance at my[NL]
feet knocking me down. Then he[NL][A]
pointed it at me demanding to know[NL]
who I was. While I laughed at him he[NL][A]
prodded his lance at my chest[NL]
accusing me of being a thief. It[NL][A]
then dawned on me that I was talking[NL]
to the young prince of the castle. I[NL][A]
asked who he was, he answered, then[NL]
I explained myself. After getting a[NL][A]
very long lecture from my mom for[NL]
almost making her lose her new job,[NL][A]
Devan and I started the slow[NL]
process of becoming freinds.[A]

#NOTE: And the award for biggest wall of text goes to Ronni!

[FarFarLeft]
#Devan
Ronni! Kenneth! We're leaving![A]
[FarLeft]
#Ronni
Welp, there's the call of duty.[NL]
Better get going.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace]
[Right]
#Kenneth
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove]So Lord Devan was tough[NL]
even at a young age.[A]
