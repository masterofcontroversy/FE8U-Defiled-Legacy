#Mayor
Ah! What ruckus! [...]What are you[NL]
doing here? Shouldn't you be out[A][NL]
there protecting us?[A]
[MidRight]
#Visitor
We were told to check[NL]
in on the villagers sir.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Mayor
Well[...]that's fine I guess. [...]You[NL]
know, tax collection day was the other[A][NL]
day. Here's the money, it should help[NL]
you with your equipment, and whatnot.[A]
[MidRight]
#Visitor
Thank you sir. I'll take this[NL]
to the duke right away.[A]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
#Mayor
...Ha ha! That solder didn't suspect[NL]
a thing! Ahh yes, money is important.[A][NL]
Especially to me. Hehe.[A]

#Mayor
Ah! What ruckus! [...]What are you[NL]
doing here? Shouldn't you be out[A][NL]
there protecting us?[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
We are. We're also checking up[NL]
on the people indoors as well.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Mayor
That's fine I suppose. [...]Say, I[NL]
collected the tax money the other day.[A][NL]
Why don't you take it? I'm sure the[NL]
duke could use it for any preperations.[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
[...]Odd, this is even[NL]
less than last time.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Mayor
Hmm?[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
I remember getting reports of Sekren[NL]
giving less, and less, taxes. I[A][NL]
guess the rumors were right about[NL]
it being you.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Mayor
[...]You're not-[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
The duke? I am. About time I came[NL]
here. The tax collectors have taken[A][NL]
to calling you Montgomery "Money Man"[NL]
with how much money you've stolen.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Mayor
B-but-[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
If you aren't willing to pay, we'll[NL]
just have to take what's rightfully[A][NL]
ours. I'm sure what's in this house[NL]
will cover it.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Mayor
Y-you can't do that![A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
I'm the duke. I can do whatever I[NL]
want. So what will it be? Will[A][NL]
you take the chance to settle your[NL]
account? Or do I have to take[A][NL]
everything from you?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Mayor
[...][A]
[MidLeft][ClearFace][.][LoadFace][0x58][0x1]
#Mayor
This is all I have.[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
[...]This will do[...]for now. I'll[NL]
expect the rest by tax collection time[A][NL]
next month.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Mayor
N-next month? That's to soon![A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
You should have thought of that before[NL]
you tried to steal from me. I'll be[A][NL]
sure to have someone inform you of how[NL]
much you owe, since you seem to be so[A][NL]
bad at math, what with your tax debt[NL]
and all.[A]

#Locksmith
Those darned bandits. I'll bet you[NL]
anything, the leader is hiding behind[A][NL]
those guys in armor.[A]
[MidRight]
#Visitor
We think so, but their armor[NL]
is too thick for us to pierce.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Locksmith
I guess you could try magic, though[NL]
mages are pretty rare around here[...][A][NL]
Oh I know! Here take this key. It[NL]
leads to the lookout area in the[A][NL]
eastern part of town. The lookout area[NL]
has two entrances. One on this side,[A][NL]
and one right behind those armored[NL]
mongrels. The key also goes to the[A][NL]
village treasurey, if you need to get[NL]
there. [...]I[...]uh used the same lock[A][NL]
for both places[...] Do me a favor, and[NL]
don't tell anyone, eh?[A]

[...]and please deliver us from danger,[NL]
like you did for our ancestors eight[A][NL]
centuries ago[...]amen.[A][NL][OpenEyes]
Oh! I'm sorry, I didn't hear you[NL]
come in. Thank the gods you're not[A][NL]
a bandit.[A]
[MidRight]
#Visitor
I didn't mean to scare you ma'am.[NL]
We're checking the villagers to see[A][NL]
if they're alright.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Woman
Oh, how wonderful! You know what?[NL]
Don't go anywhere.[A][NL]
[MidLeft][ClearFace][.][LoadFace][0x62][0x1]
Here.[A]
[MidRight]
#Visitor
Thank you, but I couldn't[...][A]
[MidLeft]
#Woman
No buts! This statue has some holy[NL]
properties to it, and I'm sure you[A][NL]
all need the blessing of the gods more[NL]
than us right now. Please, take it.[A]
[MidRight]
#Visitor
[...]Alright, thank you, miss.[A]

Oh- have you seen a boy about this[A][NL]
tall, with hair the same color as[NL]
mine?[A]

Sorry, I haven't[A]
[MidLeft]

If you find him please tell him to[NL]
come home. Oh, where could he be[...][A]
