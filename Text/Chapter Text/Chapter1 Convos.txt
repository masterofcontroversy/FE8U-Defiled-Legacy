#Devan
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[MidRight]
#Ronni
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So, Are we going to talk or something?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Devan
About what? We're in[NL]
the middle of a skirmish.[A]
[MidRight]
#Ronni
Given our experience we should be[NL]
able to talk and fight at the same[NL][A]
time. Tell me about what you were[NL]
dreaming about earlier today.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Devan
It wasn't anything special, just a[NL]
peaceful day without having to fight[NL][A]
a perpectual war against obscene crime.[A]
[MidRight]
#Ronni
Right, simple stuff. Can you[NL]
imagine life without having to[NL][A]
fight? We'd be able to worry about[NL]
normal things[ToggleMouthMove]...[.......][ToggleMouthMove] That'd be nice.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Devan
There's no point in fantasizing about[NL]
something that's never happening. I'm[NL][A]
pressing on, make sure to not get[NL]
flanked.[A]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
This is really getting to him[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove][A]

#Kenneth
Whew.[A]
[MidRight][LoadDevan]
#Devan
Getting tired already?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
Oh, ah. No sir.[NL]
I'm good to go for hours.[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
I was talking more about[NL]
your mental state. This[NL][A]
is your first battle after all.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove]in that case, I'm doing[NL]
pretty bad I guess.[NL][A]
I'm amazed I haven't thrown up.[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
For someone so uncomfortable with[NL]
fighting, you're awfully skilled[NL][A]
with weaponry.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
That's thanks to my sister. She's a[NL]
knight in the holy kingdom, she[NL][A]
tought me how to use a sword and[NL]
lance mostly for self defense.[NL][A]
The time I spent training with[NL]
the other recruits helped me[NL][A]
polish those skills.[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
I see... Then in that case maybe[NL]
I can rely on you to keep up with[NL][A]
me. Let's go.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
Yes sir![A]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
#Devan
Oh, and Kenneth![A]
[MidLeft][LoadKenneth]
#Kenneth
Yes?[A]
[MidRight]
#Devan
You probably should use your sword[NL]
against the brigands instead of[NL][A]
that lance.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
Oh. Oops. Hehe[ToggleMouthMove]...[.....][ToggleMouthMove][A]

#Ronni
Hey Kenny, how're you holding up?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
About as well as expected I guess.[A]
[MidRight]
#Ronni
I wouldn't worry if I were you,[NL]
these are just a few bandit[NL][A]
stragglers. They normally don't come[NL]
in such small numbers. Just make[NL][A]
sure not to go too far ahead and[NL]
you should be fine.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenneth
Say Ronni, how long have you been[NL]
in the Duramontis army?[A]
[MidRight]
#Ronni
Oh, about three years give[NL]
or take a month. Why?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kennth
That long huh? I'm not sure I could[NL]
handle this for that long, and be[NL][A]
so laid back about it no less.[A]
[MidRight]
#Ronni
It gets easier to deal with[NL]
in time. Though I suppose[NL][A]
that doesn't apply to Devan.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Kenenth
You're on a first name[NL]
basis with Lord Devan?[NL][A]
[MidRight]
#Ronni
Woops. Didn't mean to let that slip.[NL]
Yeah, we knew each other since we[NL][A]
were kids. We met about a year[NL]
before Devan inherited the throne[NL][A]
and- Oh! There goes a bandit. Let's[NL]
talk about this later.[A]
[MidRight][ClearFace]

#Kenneth
...Did she just ride towards[NL]
the enemy ahead of me?[A]

#Kenneth
Hey, Anthony?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Anthony
Yeah, Kid?[A]
[MidRight]
#Kenneth
I was thinking about what you said[NL]
earlier. About mounted solders being[NL][A]
in the advance team.[A]
[MidLeft]
#Anthony
And?[A]
[MidRight]
#Kenneth
Why are you here? You don't ride a[NL]
horse or seem to be a commander.[NL][A]
Wouldn't it make more sense for you[NL]
to guard the village with the[NL][A]
infantry?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Anthony
Maybe, but I have somethin' very[NL]
useful for huntin' down bandits.[A]
[MidRight]
#Kenneth
What?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Anthony
Experience workin' with em.[A]
[MidRight]
#Kenneth
You mean you used to be a raider?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Anthony
Yup. Just like the men you see here,[NL]
I got in a bad way and turned to[NL][A]
pillaging as a source of food.[A]
[MidRight]
#Kennth
So, how did you end up[NL]
working for Lord Devan?[A]
[MidLeft]
#Anthony
It's a long story, and we don't have[NL]
the time. Tell ya what? If you live[NL][A]
long enough, I might tell you.[A]
[MidRight]
#Kenneth
I'll try.[A]
