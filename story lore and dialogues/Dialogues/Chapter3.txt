Chapter 3: Into the fire

[Open to village night scene]
[Devan, Ronni, Kenneth and Brock onscreen]
Devan: "Stay here you three. I need to handle some business."
[Devan leaves]
Kenneth: "...He's going to the bar. What business does he need to handle there?"
Ronni: "He probably wants a drink. Devan's a heavy drinker don't ya know?"
Kenneth: "What!?"
Ronni: "Just kidding. There's someone Devan's looking for, and he's probably in the bar."
Brock: "Who would that be?"
Ronni: "Well..."
[Open to tavern scene]
[Colton onscreen]
Colton: "Ahh. That's the stuff. I needed a break."
[Devan onscreen]
Devan: "Hello Colton, It's been a while."
Colton: "I figured you'd be here. Let me guess: You want me to find out where these bandits are holed up."
Devan: "That's the gist of it. Do you wan't to help, or should I set up the noose?"
Colton: "Heh. you say that, but these guys are no joke. The new leader's some former captain from Tolva. He even managed to kill that old general."
Devan: "A Tolvan captain huh? He should still be beatable if the element of surprise is taken away from him."
Colton: "And what if you can't kill him? If they find out I told you where they are, they'll do things to me that'll scare even you."
Devan: "And they'll continue doing thigs to our country that already do scare me. They don't spare anyone. If they aren't stopped, there won't be anything left."
Colton: "What does it matter if they live or die now? They'll be killed either way. If not by the bandits, they'll be killed by you."
Devan: "I know, but even then, I have to save those people. I swore to on my coronation day."
Colton: "Because you swore to? To what? Not to bail out on us like your parents?"
Devan: "..."
Colton: "Why are you helping Duramontis anyway? Do you care about us? Do you want to be who your mother wasn't? Or maybe you just don't have anything else to do with your life."
Devan: "...It's a mix of the three. The small humane part of me wants to help this country, I want to spite my mother, and I was born the to be the duke of  
    Duramontis. It's all I've ever known."
Colton: "...Well, at least you're honest. Alright, I'll help you. I'd probably die somewere down the road anyway. What's a few years?"
Devan: "Thank you."

Ronni: "Hey Colton, Been a while, hasn't it?"
Colton: "Yeah, yeah. Let's get going."
[Colton leaves]
Ronni: "What's up with him?"
Devan: "I'll tell you on the way."
