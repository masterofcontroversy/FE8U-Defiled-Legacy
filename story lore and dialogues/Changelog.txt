{
    Notes:
    (Steps taken to install holy blood hack):
        Listed holy blood getters.event in _MasterHackInstaller.event
        Pointed to the holy blood table event files to "Table Installer.event"
        Pointed to HolyBloodTable, HolyBloodCharacterTable, and HolyBloodGetter in GrowthGetters.event
        Added contents of holyblood.txt to statcreen.txt ("HolyBloodText" is in conflict with the asm
            file. to fix, change the previous text to "BloodText")
        Pointed to HolyBloodWeaponLocks (For the weapon locks)
    
        Added holy blood to the ModularStatScreen by: copying mss_page4.s and mss_page4.dmp from The HolyBlood/MSS/asm folder
        and pasting to the asm folder, then placing the following between "#else // ENABLE_PERSONAL_INFO",
            and "#endif // ENABLE_PERSONAL_INFO":
            
                ALIGN 4:
                    #incbin "asm/mss_page4.dmp"
                    WORD SS_BloodText
                    POIN HolyBloodNameGetter|1
                    POIN HolyBloodVoracityGetter|1
                
                ALIGN 4:
                    #include "asm/mss_threepageconditional.lyn.event"
                    POIN PersonalDataTable
        
    (To self):
        When adding a major blood aside from the first one use the ^ operator between the blood id and 0x80 bit (I know you're going to forget)
        Investigate if "POIN PersonalDataTable" is needed
        Be sure to use the statcreen_text.txt file to add champion's blood names and descriptions
