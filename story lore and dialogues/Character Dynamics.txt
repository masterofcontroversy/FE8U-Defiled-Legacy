    Alexandra follows Devan's troop when he is sent to the front lines. After discovering her presence, he has
    no choice but to let her stay, otherwise if Alexandra came into any harm, Devan would be blamed.
    Luckily for Alexandra, she was at the wrong place at the right time. After a month of fighting passed,
    The emperial captial was captured along with the emperor himself.
    Opon hearing this, Devan decided it would be best to leave Alexandra with her retainer and go home
    to watch the ensuing war from a distance.
    Alexandra however, needed help to free her father, so she petitioned to the only pearson who wasn't looking for
    her: Devan. After a long winded discussion Alexandra eventually begs and offers to give Devan the Ensiferum if he helps her.
    That was enough to convince Devan. After the war Alexandra returns home and grows to become the best emperess Tolva has ever had.
    If Alexandra and Devan obtain an A support, once Alexandra is crowned emperess, she makes Devan her top general. Later when pressed on the matter of heirs,
    they helped eachother find a solution. (In other words: They got married about a year after Alexandra was crowned.)

    Devan and Ronni grew closer as friends, and Devan's general opinions on women started changing. three years after working in the castle Ronni's mother
    died from the flu. After the funeral, Ronni was about to leave the castle to find some work, but was stopped by Devan. Ronni was offered a job as Devan's
