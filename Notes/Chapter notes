-Chapter 3 notes:
    At the beginning of the chapter a child will hide in a berral next to the boss. If the boss is not
    engaged in combat before turn 10, the child will be found and killed, and the boss will leave due to
    the sun rising. If the child is saved, you will receive an item. The chapter will end after this event.
    (After the cutscene with the child, tell the player that they have 10 turns to trigger combat with the
    boss before something happens to the child)

    There are strong enemies guarding the direct route to the boss. There is also however, a guard station
    that has been left unwatched. Either have Colton or someone else with a door key open the door to the
    station, and you can bypass the strong enemies.
    
    If Devan visits the mayor, he'll notice the mayor is trying to cheat on taxes. Devan will point this out
    and the mayor will hand over the rest of the gold, giving you 7500G. If anyone else visits the mayor,
    you'll receive 5000G.
