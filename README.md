# FE8U-Defiled-Legacy
ROM hack of Fire Emblem 8

## Building Instructions
### For linux (I use Arch btw):  
Install wine and wintricks, use winetricks to install .Net  
If python gives you an error saying that it can't find "libffi.so.6", create a syslink from "libffi.so.6" to "libffi.so.7"
then run MakeHack.  
(Tested in Ubuntu Arch, and Fedora) (Patching does not work on Ubuntu)

### Windows:
Unfortunatly, I haven't written any scripts for building with Windows since I don't use it that often. I will be making one soon though.  

If you still want to build the ROM and you're on Windows, you can compress the png files in the "Map sprites" and "Tilesets" directory,
then you can get the MAKEHACK batch files from the SkillSystem repository and run it.  
(The reason using Linux is currently the easiest way to build is because the png files get compressed automatically with the PNG2Dmp script)
